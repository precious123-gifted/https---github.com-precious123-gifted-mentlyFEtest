### Why Your Images Might Not Show on GitHub  
1. Ensure that your images are in the correct `./assets/` directory relative to your `README.md` file.  
2. GitHub does not serve images from the `public` folder in Next.js projects. Move your images to an `assets` folder in the root or in the same directory as `README.md`.  
   **Example:** `![Mently Desktop View](./assets/mently-desktop-design1.png)`  
3. Double-check for typos in your image file paths and ensure they match exactly.
